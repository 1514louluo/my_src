autobuilder:
	version ->2.0
	env ->just for linux or unix platform, with gcc or clang compiler
	aim ->just for convenient 
add new feature:
	auto generate makefile.comm
	user only need to input cflag, dlibs, slibs, for example you want to -L/usr/local -lcurl,
	you only find "DLIBS = " in user.comm, and input "DLIBS = curl". slibs is same, /usr/local/log4cplus/liblog4cplus.a,
	you only find "SLIBS = " in user.comm, and input "SLIBS = log4cplus". special_dlibs just for "-wl,rpath, "
operate sequence:
	1. move all dir in autobuilder to your program root dir, command just like:
	   mv autobuilder/*  /XXXX/XXXX/YOUR PROGRAM
	2. modify 'makefile.comm' in 'build' dir, add your own -I/dir or -llib 	
	3. ./configure, get detail by command:
	   ./configure --help    or      ./configure -h
	4. make	
	5. make install
	6. make clean
	7. make distclean
	
thanks:
	idea come from hengpan's raw framework and jiaxin help me test!
